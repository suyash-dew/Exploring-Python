Showcasing nuances of working with Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib, and Tensorflow as major libraries with a variety of datasets including webscraping a few datasets. Other libraries used are re, dateutil,

Importing a variety of datasets as Pandas dataframes, then performing data cleaning and data wrangling. 

Plotting with Matplotlib and building a custom visualization with interactivity and animation implementing Edward R. Tufte's and Alberto Cairo's principles.

Training different Supervised Machine Learning models - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression,
Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, Ensemble methods - Boosting and Bootstrapping, Gradient Boosted Trees,Random Forest, Neural Networks, understanding the differences between their performance and various performance scores, and tuning the hyperparameters for the optimal performance.
